========

**Make arbitrarily structured, arbitrary-dimension boxes.**

`powerbox` is a pure-python code for creating density grids (or boxes) that have an arbitrary two-point distribution
(i.e. power spectrum). Primary motivations for creating the code were the simple creation of lognormal mock galaxy
distributions, but the methodology can be used for other applications.

Features
--------
* Works in any number of dimensions
* Arbitrary isotropic power-spectra.
* Arbitrary 1-point density distributions.
* Really simple.
